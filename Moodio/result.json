When pyridine is protonated, this lone pair accepts a proton, forming a pyridinium ion. The aromaticity of the ring, derived from the delocalized \u03c0 electrons, remains intact.\n*   Pyridine is a *weaker* base than aliphatic amines because its lone pair is in an sp2 orbital (more s-character, more tightly held) compared to sp3 in aliphatic amines.\n*   Pyridine is a *stronger* base than pyrrole because pyrrole's lone pair is part of its aromatic system, and protonation would destroy its aromaticity.\n\n**Q2: In substituted cyclohexanes, which position does a large substituent generally prefer?**\nThe correct answer is: **Equatorial**\n*   Large substituents prefer the equatorial position to minimize steric interactions, particularly 1,3-diaxial interactions, which are present when a substituent is in the axial position. This makes the equatorial conformer more stable.\n\n**Q3: The Wittig reaction is primarily used for the synthesis of which functional group?**\nThe correct answer is: **Alkenes**\n*   The Wittig reaction is a powerful method for converting a carbonyl compound (aldehyde or ketone) into an alkene using a phosphorus ylide.\n\n**Q4: In 1H NMR spectroscopy, protons adjacent to which of the following functional groups typically exhibit the highest chemical shift (most deshielded)?**\nThe correct answer is: **Carbonyl group (aldehyde)**\n*   Protons directly attached to an aldehyde carbon (R-CHO) are highly deshielded due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the oxygen atom and magnetic anisotropy of the C=O bond. They typically appear in the range of 9-10 ppm, which is generally the highest chemical shift among the given options for common proton types.\n\n**Q5: Arrange pyrrole, furan, and thiophene in decreasing order of reactivity towards electrophilic aromatic substitution.**\nThe correct answer is: **Pyrrole > Furan > Thiophene**\n*   The reactivity towards electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) in these five-membered heterocycles depends on the ability of the heteroatom to donate its lone pair electrons into the aromatic ring, thus increasing electron density.\n    *   Nitrogen (in pyrrole) is less electronegative than oxygen (in furan) and readily donates its lone pair, making pyrrole the most reactive.\n    *   Oxygen (in furan) is more electronegative than nitrogen, so it donates electrons less effectively than nitrogen.\n    *   Sulfur (in thiophene) is larger than oxygen, leading to less effective orbital overlap with the carbon p-orbitals despite its lower electronegativity compared to oxygen, making thiophene the least reactive among the three, though still more reactive than benzene.\n\n**Q6: The Diels-Alder reaction is an example of which type of pericyclic reaction?**\nThe correct answer is: **Cycloaddition reaction**\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition, where a diene (4 \u03c0-electrons) reacts with a dienophile (2 \u03c0-electrons) to form a cyclic product.\n\n**Q7: Many alkaloids are biosynthesized from which common amino acid precursor?**\nThe correct answer is: **Tryptophan**\n*   Tryptophan is a crucial precursor for a vast number of alkaloids, including indole alkaloids (e.g., strychnine, psilocybin) and many quinoline alkaloids. Other amino acids like tyrosine, phenylalanine, lysine, and ornithine are also common precursors for different classes of alkaloids, but tryptophan is a widely recognized precursor for many important alkaloid families.\n\n**Q8: Which reagent is typically used to selectively oxidize a primary alcohol to an aldehyde without further oxidation to a carboxylic acid?**\nThe correct answer is: **PCC (Pyridinium chlorochromate)**\n*   PCC is a mild oxidizing agent that is specifically used to oxidize primary alcohols to aldehydes and secondary alcohols to ketones, stopping at the aldehyde stage for primary alcohols.\n*   KMnO4, CrO3/H2SO4 (Jones reagent), and H2CrO4 (chromic acid) are strong oxidizing agents that would typically oxidize a primary alcohol all the way to a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Q9: Which of the following is commonly used as a protecting group for amines during organic synthesis?**\nThe correct answer is: **Boc (tert-Butoxycarbonyl)**\n*   The Boc group forms a carbamate with the amine (N-Boc), protecting the nitrogen from undesired reactions. It is widely used because it is stable under various reaction conditions and can be selectively removed by mild acid treatment (e.g., trifluoroacetic acid, TFA).\n\n**Q10: Acid-catalyzed ring opening of an unsymmetrical epoxide with methanol typically occurs at which carbon atom?**\nThe correct answer is: **The more substituted carbon**\n*   In acid-catalyzed epoxide opening, the oxygen atom is protonated, making the epoxide carbons more electrophilic. The reaction proceeds through a transition state with significant carbocation character at the more substituted carbon. The nucleophile (methanol) preferentially attacks the carbon that can better stabilize this partial positive charge, which is the more substituted carbon. This is different from base-catalyzed opening, which follows an SN2 mechanism and attacks the less substituted carbon."}, {"User": "give me a time table", "Bot": "Okay, I can give you a *general daily timetable template*.
